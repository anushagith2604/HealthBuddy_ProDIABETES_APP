# ü©∏ A1C Pathology Test ‚Äì Diabetes Prediction App

A lightweight machine learning-based web application built using **Streamlit** to predict whether a patient is diabetic, based on clinical input data including glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and more.

---

## üß† Overview

This app uses a trained machine learning model (saved in `.sav` format) to predict **diabetes status** from key health indicators derived from A1C and related pathology tests. Users can enter test values through a simple web form, and get an instant prediction result.

## üîç Key Features

* ü©∫ Predicts if a patient is **diabetic or not**
* üìä Uses 8 important input features (from Pima Indian dataset or similar)
* üñ•Ô∏è Built with **Streamlit** ‚Äì deployable on local or cloud
* üß† Uses a pre-trained model saved as `trained_model.sav`

## üöÄ How to Run the App

### 1. Clone the repository or download the `.py` script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/a1c-diabetes-predictor.git
cd a1c-diabetes-predictor
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install streamlit numpy scikit-learn
```

### 3. Place your trained model

Place your `trained_model.sav` in the correct path. (Update the code if needed ‚Äî ideally avoid hardcoding Windows paths.)

```bash
# Example: Save the model in the current directory
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ trained_model.sav
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
```

### 4. Run the Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è File Structure

```
a1c-diabetes-predictor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                 # Streamlit main app file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ trained_model.sav      # Pre-trained ML model (pickle format)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

---

## üß† Model Info

The model can be trained using the **Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset** from Kaggle/UCI. It is serialized using `pickle` as `trained_model.sav`.

> **Note:** Always normalize/scale data the same way it was during training.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues in Current Code

You need to fix these small errors:

### 1. Fix `if __name__ == '__main__'` line:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### 2. Convert inputs to `float` before prediction:

```python
diagnosis = diabetes_prediction([float(Pregnancies), float(Glucose), ...])
```
